# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone, focused on analyzing historical bike trip data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. The goal of the analysis is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and to develop strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Objectives

- **Usage Patterns Analysis:** Identify and compare the usage patterns between annual members and casual riders, focusing on trip frequency, duration, and time of use.
- **Membership Conversion Strategies:** Develop actionable recommendations for increasing annual memberships based on the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes historical trip data provided by Cyclistic. The data includes information such as trip start and end times, trip duration, starting and ending locations, and rider type (casual or member). The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure accuracy.

- **[Cyclistic Bike Share Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html):** The data is publicly available and can be accessed via this link. Please note that the data has been anonymized and does not contain personal information.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** The data was cleaned to handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and summary statistics were generated to explore the data and uncover patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical methods were applied to compare the differences between the two rider types and identify significant trends.
4. **Data Visualization:** Bar charts were created to visualize the findings.

## Key Findings

- **Member Riders' Commuting** Significant differences in trip duration, frequency, and time of use between casual riders and annual members were identified.
- **Casual Riders' Recreation:** Casual riders use the bikes for leisure, city exploration, and outdoor activities, showing a more flexible and recreational usage pattern.
- **Seasonal Popularity:** Usage peaks during the summer months, especially in July and August, due to favorable weather and longer daylight hours.
- **Weekend Usage:** Both member and casual riders show increased bike usage on weekends, likely driven by more free time and leisure opportunities.

## Recommendations

- **Summer Membership:** Members primarily use the bike service for daily work commutes, integrating it into their weekday routines.
- **Weekday & Short Trip Discounts:** Introduce discounts for weekday and short trips to encourage casual riders to use bikes for daily commutes rather than just recreational activities.
- **Promote Regular Use:** Highlight the convenience, health benefits, and environmental impact of biking to motivate casual riders to adopt regular bike usage.

## Tools Used
- **MS Excel:** To prepare the data for analysis
- **Python:** Programming language chosen for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Python package, for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Python package, for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the usage patterns of Cyclisticâ€™s bike-sharing service, highlighting opportunities to increase annual memberships. The recommendations derived from this analysis are aimed at helping Cyclistic optimize their services and marketing strategies.
