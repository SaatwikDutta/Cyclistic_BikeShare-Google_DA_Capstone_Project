# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone, focused on analyzing historical bike trip data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. The goal of the analysis is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and to develop strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Objectives

- **Usage Patterns Analysis:** Identify and compare the usage patterns between annual members and casual riders, focusing on trip frequency, duration, and time of use.
- **Membership Conversion Strategies:** Develop actionable recommendations for increasing annual memberships based on the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes historical trip data provided by Cyclistic. The data includes information such as trip start and end times, trip duration, starting and ending locations, and rider type (casual or member). The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure accuracy.

- **[Cyclistic Bike Share Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html):** The data is publicly available and can be accessed via this link. Please note that the data has been anonymized and does not contain personal information.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** The data was cleaned to handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and summary statistics were generated to explore the data and uncover patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical methods were applied to compare the differences between the two rider types and identify significant trends.
4. **Data Visualization:** Bar charts were created to visualize the findings.

## Key Findings

- **Behavioral Insights:** Significant differences in trip duration, frequency, and time of use between casual riders and annual members were identified.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Usage peaks were observed during specific seasons and times of the day, providing insights into rider behavior.
- **Conversion Opportunities:** Based on the analysis, top 3 strategies were recommended to Cyclistic to encourage casual riders to become annual members.

## Recommendations

- **Summer Membership:** Offer a seasonal membership to attract casual riders during peak summer months, providing a stepping stone toward full annual memberships.
- **Weekday & Short Trip Discounts:** Introduce discounts for weekday and short trips to encourage casual riders to use bikes for daily commutes rather than just recreational activities.
- **Promote Regular Use:** Highlight the convenience, health benefits, and environmental impact of biking to motivate casual riders to adopt regular bike usage.

## Tools Used
- **MS Excel:** To prepare the data for analysis
- **Python:** For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the usage patterns of Cyclisticâ€™s bike-sharing service, highlighting opportunities to increase annual memberships. The recommendations derived from this analysis are aimed at helping Cyclistic optimize their services and marketing strategies.
